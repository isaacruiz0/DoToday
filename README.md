## Why another todo list?
I like having a brief mental map of whatever project I am working on then hitting checkpoints back to back throughout the day. Sometimes I get mixed up recalling what I need to do next so I figured it would be easier to write my mental map down. After trying a few todo list apps I got tired of how slow and bloated they such as requiring you to sign up and having all these excessive features so I decided to create an app that fits my work style. This means getting straight to the point without delay.
